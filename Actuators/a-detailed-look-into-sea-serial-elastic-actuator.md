# A Detailed Look into SEA\(Serial Elastic Actuator\)

## why we need to know this

SEA is a commonly used actuator. It is powerful, a lot of research and product are based on SEA. For example, the Rethink Robotcs widely use SEA in their colaborate robot, Hebi Robotics use SEA in their modules as well.

 Hebi Modules

More importantly, I am recently dealing with SEA motors from HEBI robotics. I have got a new [Daisy Robot](http://docs.hebi.us/resources/kits/assyInstructions/X-Series_Hexapod.pdf). The Robot is heavy and it trembles a lot while walking. So I want to make it crystal clear that I understand the motor in the very basic level.

This also help understanding the famous branch of actuator.

## What is SEA

SEA is a mechanical mechanism. It could add to any kind of actuators if properly designed. To put it simple, it attach a spring bwtween the end shaft of the motor, to create elasticity and reduce stiffness of the motor.

## A little bit of history
